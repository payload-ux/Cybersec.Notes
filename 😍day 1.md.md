2.  Integrity 
    - involves making sure your data is trustworthy and free from tampering /change.
3.  Availability
    - Availability means information resources are accessible when you need them.	
 
    for example cyber attacks on a government website causing downtime .


## skills we need to be hacker 
- computer programming
- computer networking 
- system understanding 
     - Linux 
     - windows


## Phases of hacking 
1. Reconnaissance
2. scanning
3. Gaining Access
4. Maintaining access
5. Clearing tracks or logs

1. Reconnaissance 
  - Gathering info about the target through passive and active means 
2. Scanning 
  - identifying open ports , services and vulnerabilities using hacking tools.
3. Gaining access
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities to access the target system.
4. Maintaining Access 
   - Establishing backdoors or persistence for continuous access.
5. covering tracks 
   - Erasing logs and hiding any intrusion.


## penetration testing 

-  penetration testing is a method of evaluating the security of an information system or network by simulating an attack to:
    - find vulnerability.
    - security measures.
    - documentation and report preparation.

## types of pentesting

1.  Black box pentesting
- testing system without prior knowledge .
- you test as an attacker
2. white box pentesting 
- testing system with prior knowledge.
- you test as an developer.
3. grey box pentesting
-  testing system with limited knowledge.
- you test as an user.
