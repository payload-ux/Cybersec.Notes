## What is a Programming Language?

- A way to communicate with computers.
    
- Human languages ≠ Computer languages.
    
- Programming languages include: C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, etc.
    

## What is a Program?

- A program is an algorithm written in a programming language.
    
- An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to perform a task.
    

## Pseudocode

- Simplified logic in plain language.
    
- Useful for planning code without worrying about syntax.

## Evolution of Input/Output

- Early: Punch cards, batch processing.
    
- Now: Interactive processing with input/output during execution.
    

## Generations of Computers

1. Vacuum Tubes – Punch cards
    
2. Transistors – Start of Assembly language
    
3. Integrated Circuits – C, BASIC, Pascal
    
4. Microprocessors – Python, SQL
    
5. AI-based systems

## Programming Language Types

### Low-Level Languages

- Closer to machine (binary)
    
- Examples: Assembly, C
    

### High-Level Languages

- Closer to human language
    
- Examples: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript
    

### How They Work

- **Compiler**: Converts entire code at once (C, Java)
    
- **Interpreter**: Executes line by line (Python)

## Python Overview

- High-level, interpreted, easy to read/write.
    
- Created by **Guido van Rossum** in the 1980s.
    
- Inspired by languages like C, ABC, Modula-3.
    

## Uses of Python

- Data visualization
    
- Web development (Django, Flask)
    
- AI & Machine Learning
    
- Game development
    
- Scripting for hacking

## Installing Python

- Windows: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org)
    
- Linux: `sudo apt install python3`
    

## IDE vs Code Editor

- **IDE**: Full development environment (e.g. PyCharm)
    
- **Code Editor**: Lightweight, multi-language (e.g. VS Code, Sublime)

## Python Basics

### Output

- Use `print()` to display output.
    
- Syntax: `print("Hello")`, `print(f"Welcome {name}")`
    

### Comments

- For notes within code.
    
- Syntax: `# This is a comment`
    

---

## Variables

- Used to store data.
    
- Example: `name = "GTST"`
    
- Use `print(f"Hello {name}")` to print variable.
    

## Data Types

### Numeric

- `int`, `float`, `complex`
    
- Use `type(var)` to check type
    

### String

- Sequence of characters: `"text"` or `'text'`
    

### List

- Ordered, changeable: `fruits = ["apple", "banana"]`
    
- Access with index: `fruits[0]`
    

### Tuple

- Ordered, unchangeable: `coords = (10, 20)`
    
- Use index: `coords[1]`
    

### Dictionary

- Key-value pairs: `user = {"name": "John", "age": 30}`
    
- Access by key: `user["name"]`
