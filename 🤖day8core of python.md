## Indexing

- Used to access elements in lists, strings, and tuples.
    
- Indexing starts at 0.
    
- Negative indexing accesses elements from the end.
    

## Slicing

- Allows accessing a section of a list or string.
    
- Format: start : stop : step
    
- Start is inclusive, stop is exclusive.
    
- Step is optional and defaults to 1.
    
- Works with negative indexing as well.

## Input Handling

**Two methods:**

1. Input function: Takes user input from the terminal.
    
2. Arguments: Pass values from the command line.

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

- Used for mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, etc.
    

### Assignment Operators

- Used to assign values to variables.
    

### Comparison Operators

- Used to compare values and return true or false.
    

### Logical Operators

- Used to combine conditional statements.
    

### Bitwise Operators

- Used for operations on binary numbers.
    
- Common in cryptography and low-level programming.
    

---

## Indentation

- Python relies on indentation to define code blocks.
    
- Proper indentation is mandatory and critical for correct program flow.
    

---

## If-Else Statements

### If Statement

- Executes a block if a condition is true.
    

### If-Else

- Adds an alternative path if the condition is false.
    

### If-Elif-Else

- Allows checking multiple conditions in sequence.
    

### Nested If

- One if-statement inside another for complex conditions.
    

---

## Errors and Exception Handling

### Common Runtime Errors

- Occur when code is syntactically correct but causes issues during execution.
    
- Examples include division by zero, out-of-range index access, and undefined variables.
    

### Handling Errors

- Use structured blocks to handle exceptions and avoid program crashes.
    

---

## Loops

### For Loop

- Used when the number of repetitions is known.
    
- Can iterate over sequences like lists, strings, and tuples.
    

### While Loop

- Used when the condition for repetition is not based on a fixed number.
    
- Runs as long as a given condition is true.
    

### Break

- Exits the loop early when a condition is met.

## Summary

- Indexing and slicing allow precise data access.
    
- Input can be gathered interactively or through arguments.
    
- Various operators handle calculations, comparisons, and logic.
    
- Indentation determines code structure in Python.
    
- Conditional statements direct program flow.
    
- Exception handling ensures stability.
    
- Loops automate repetition and make code more efficient.
